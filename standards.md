# Standards
When contributing to the frontend, ensure that all code written follows the following standards so that it is consistent with the rest of the project.

## General Standards
- Variable, function, and method names should be descriptive. It should be easy to tell what the variable is for just from the name
- Code should be commented. All significant code blocks should have comments explaining what they do. All methods should be commented as  well.
- Keep everything organized, logical and understandable. The easier the code is to read and understand, the easier it will be to maintain.
  
## React Standards
- Only 1 component per file
- Use PascalCase for component names (ex: `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Use camelCase for non-component file names
- Use camelCase for folder names

## CSS Standards
- Use soft tabs with a 2 space indent
- Use double quotes
- Use shorthand notation where possible.
- Put spaces after `:` in property declarations.
- Put spaces before `{` in rule declarations.
- Use hex color codes `#000` unless using `rgba()`.
- Use one line per property declaration.
- Always follow a rule with one line of whitespace.
- Always quote `url()` and `@import()` contents.
- Do not indent blocks.
- All ids, classes and attributes must be lowercase with hyphens used for separation (e.g `.profile-picture` and not `.profilepicture`)
- All id, class, and attribute names should be descriptive, and describe either what the content is or what styling is 
- Comments should be used to explain anything that may be unclear at first glance
